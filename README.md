# Username Filter Contribution Guidelines

This repository contains the list of words and phrases that are filtered from usernames. Before contributing, please read the rules carefully to ensure consistency and prevent unintended blocking.

## Guidelines

1. **Add only unambiguous offensive or inappropriate words**  
   - Avoid words that could also be used as common names, harmless terms, or have multiple interpretations.  
   - Example of words to avoid:  
     - `mental` (can be used in non-offensive contexts)  
     - `bugger` (can appear as a name)

2. **Check context**  
   - Consider how a word might appear in usernames. Do not add words that are harmless in most contexts.

3. **Formatting contributions**  
   - Add one word or phrase per line.  
   - Use lowercase only.

4. **Testing**  
   - Before submitting, verify that your addition wonâ€™t block innocent usernames.

## How to Contribute

1. Fork the repository.  
2. Make your edits following the guidelines above.  
3. Submit a pull request with a brief description of your additions.

Thank you for helping keep usernames safe and appropriate!
